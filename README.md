# MLB-Weather-Attendance
An analysis of the effect of temperature on MLB attendance per game.

All data was pulled from reliable websites (www.retrosheet.org and w2.weather.gov). The purpose of the analysis is to provide further 
data-backed clarity on the effect of temperature and other relevant variables on attendance per game at MLB games from 
1990-2017.
